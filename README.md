# scumwiz
Perl script for automated NetHack startscumming

Requirements: SSH, GNU Screen & Perl incl. perl modules List::MoreUtils and Time::HiRes.
I really need to write a more detailed readme, but scumwiz.pl now has a fairly detailed
usage text if you run it with the flag -h or -help

This will explain how to run it, and some things you need to have set up in your rcfile

the above information about the helptext might not be accurate at all anymore,
also i am mainly using scumwiz-2.pl for scumming on NAO currently. this script is pretty awful and,
to anybody who tries to use it, im really sorry that its so bad, but if you find me
on IRC (Libera network, nick: aoei), i might be able to help you out a bit
